   "comments": "I found DR online in a high times review and decided to pop in today. Their location is clean and in a relatively upscale spot. Everyone was really professional and you could tell that they actually cared about their customers. The prices are really low compared to my old spot, it may have something to do with the fact DR doesn't package their product in the medicine bottle, they use bags and at first it kind of bugged me but after trying their bud and seeing that it really is the best around I think I can deal with it. I bought HP-13, OG-18, Reserva Privada, Gumbo, Bio-Diesel and Outer Space. So far I've had Outer Space and its exactly what the name says. Sorry if this review is all over the place but my brain and OS are duking it out right now. Just go in and grab a few grams and see what the buzz is about."

   "comments": "Strains were there, but as a medical customer it was a total rip off. Rec has made it difficult to find high quality affordable meds- and Denver Relief is the prime example of over inflating prices to take advantage of legalization AND their customers. Even though we were the ONLY people there we sat in the waiting room for 10+ minutes listening to the guy who helped us joke. Staff is pretentious and throw every gimmick sales pitch at you they have. \"One of Denvers oldest\", but not finest. "
